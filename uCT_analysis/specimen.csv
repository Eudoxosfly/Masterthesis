BA38;Test with brass plate;standard;B6;Brass plate absorbs heat, with standard settings, the particles will not be fully embedded;y
BA37;2x normal settings;standard;B2;with two passes of normal settings, previously embedded particles start creating evaporation cavities again;y
BA36;2x normal settings;standard;B6;to a lower degree, this also happens with the structured particles;y
AD77;cross pattern;10 mm distance, 80 % duty cycle, 15 mm/s;B6;more evaporation in vertical cross line than horizontal, lots of coffee stain effect;y
AD76;cross pattern;10 mm distance, 80 % duty cycle, 30 mm/s;B6;same amount of evaporation for vertical and horizontal direction, bit less cavity overall, also coffee stain effect;y
AD68;cross pattern;10 mm distance, 33 % duty cycle, 10 mm/s;B6;massive (250 um) cavity, not homogenous, some coffee stain;y
AD67;standard setting batch test;standard;B2;homogenous fusion where particles are, nearly no evaporation, spread of liquid PMMA to zones with lower particle density;y
AD66;standard setting batch test;standard;B9;homogenous fusion, some bright particle (steel?) in there;y
AD64;standard setting batch test;standard;B25;homogenous fusion, some smaller cavities, bright particle again;y
AD63;standard setting batch test;standard;B6;homogenous fusion, some smaller cavities (more than B25?);y

AD52;standard setting batch test, low pressure;standard;B6;evaporation along scan lines, but next to them good fusion;y

AD50;cross pattern;10 mm distance, 10 mm/s pattern;B25;pattern visible, but overshadowed by evaporation along scan lines, low pressure;y
AD48;standard setting batch test, low pressure;standard;B25;towards AD52, the clamping pressure got progressively worse, so this one shows quite a bit of evaporation, but not as much as the later ones.;y
AD45;standard setting batch test;standard;B25;shows some evaporation, shows melt zone extension into low density zone;y

AD36;standard setting batch test;standard;B9;nicely embedded, nearly no evaporation, high density, melt zone expansion;y
AD33;time constant testing;10x(20 ms on, 40 ms off);B6;good example for evaporation, too long o time, also lots of small particles;y
AD32;time constant testing;10x(20 ms on, 80 ms off);B6;shows that overlong on time cannot be compensated by longer off time;y
AD31;time constant testing;10x(10 ms on, 40 ms off);B6;no evaporation, gap not fully closed, melt zone too small, shows too long off time;y
AD29;time constant testing;10x(5 ms on, 20 ms off);B6;no evaporation, gap not fully closed;y
AD28;time constant testing;standard;B6;very few particles, no evaporation, gap not fully closed at the edges, shows melt zone expansion;y
AD21;time constant testing;standard;B6;quite a bit of evaporation, super high particle density, looks like evaporation dominantly in high density regions;y
AD20;time constant testing;7x(49 ms on, 146 ms off);B6;lots of evaporation;y
AD19;time constant testing;7x(43 ms on, 87 ms off);B6;lots of evaporation, predominantly along scan lines;y
AD18;time constant testing;3x(35 ms on, 35 ms off);B6;evaporation directly in between particles, but not too much, looks actually quite good;y
AD17;time constant testing, priming pass;3x35 ms on/off, 5x95 ms on/off;B6;huge amount of evaporation, gigantic cavities, also some pitting;y
AD16;time constant testing;3x(91 ms on, 91 ms off);B6;huge evaporation, low density of particles;y
